## Project Description
The most common way to test SNPs for association with a phenotype is via classical association analysis (i.e., least 
squares regression). However, it is now increasingly common to instead use mixed-model analyses (MMA). The main 
advantage of MMA is that it reduces false positives due to population structure and relatedness. Further, it can increase 
power to detect (because instead of testing SNPs individually, it uses a multi-SNP model).    

Objective 1 – This project will first evaluate different MMA software (e.g., Bolt-LMM, SAIGE, REGENIE) on large scale 
data (e.g., 300k individuals and 600k SNPs from UK Biobank) for a wide variety of traits (both simulated and real). 
Methods will be compared based on type 1 error, power and speed.    

Objective 2 – This project will compare strategies for analyzing multi-ancestry datasets. In particular, it will quantify the 
power increase (or decrease) of MMAA (analyzing all individuals together) with per-ancestry analyses (e.g., analyze 
European, African and Asian separately, then meta-analyse the three sets of results). In particular, it will investigate 
whether the optimum strategy depends on consistency of genetic architecture across ancestries.    

Objective 3 – This project will construct prediction models (PRS) computed using the results of MMA, and compare their 
accuracy (and transferability across populations) with PRS computed from classical association analysis.

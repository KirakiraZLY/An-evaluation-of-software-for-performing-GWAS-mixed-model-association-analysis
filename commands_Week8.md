## Test Mixed Model on different parameters
### Simulate phenotypes based on different parameters
Quantitative/ Binary   
Number of Causal: 1000, 10000   
h2: 0.1, 0.5, 0.9   
heritability model: GCTA, LDAK   
Number of individuals: 10K, 70K   
Replicate Phenotypes: 5 phenotypes   

High number of causal SNPs will have high polygenicity, and decrease the effect size of each SNP.
